A personal challenge that I started my Sophomore year that I abandoned.

I've removed all my previous tries, and I'm starting from scratch. I'll
be comparing my new code to my old code to see how I've improved. Also, I'll
be implementing each problem in several languages to solidify their syntax
into my mind.
